OBD-II CAN Bus Simulator using an ESP32 (Node32) and an ELM327 involves simulating vehicle data on a CAN bus, allowing diagnostic tools/apps to read simulated parameters like RPM or speed
1. Hardware Setup
Components Needed
ESP32 (Node32): Acts as the CAN bus simulator (emulating the ECU).

ELM327 Module: Bridges the simulated CAN bus to a diagnostic tool (e.g., via Bluetooth).

CAN Transceiver (e.g., SN65HVD230): Converts ESP32’s logic-level signals to CAN bus levels.

120Ω Resistors: For CAN bus termination (prevents signal reflections).

Wiring
ESP32 to CAN Transceiver:

Connect GPIO5 (TX) to CAN_TX of the transceiver.

Connect GPIO4 (RX)toCAN_RX` of the transceiver.

Power the transceiver with 3.3V and GND.

CAN Bus Connections:

Connect CAN_H and CAN_L from the transceiver to the ELM327’s CAN lines.

Add a 120Ω resistor between CAN_H and CAN_L at both ends of the bus.

Power:

Power the ESP32 and ELM327 via USB or a 5V supply.

2. Software Setup
ESP32 Code (Arduino Framework)
Install Libraries:

Use the ACAN_ESP32 library for CAN communication.

Code Logic:

Initialize CAN bus at 500 kbps (standard OBD-II speed).

Listen for OBD-II requests (CAN ID 0x7DF).

Respond with simulated data for requested PIDs (e.g., RPM, speed).

3. ELM327 Configuration
Connect to CAN Bus:

Ensure the ELM327 is set to CAN protocol (e.g., ATSP6 for CAN 500 kbps).

Use ATH1 to show headers for debugging.

Pair with Diagnostic Tool:

Connect your phone/PC to the ELM327 via Bluetooth/USB.

Use apps like Torque Pro or OBD Auto Doctor to test queries.

4. Testing
Query Simulated Data:

Request RPM with PID 0x0C or speed with 0x0D.

The ESP32 should respond with the values programmed in the code.

Troubleshooting:

Verify CAN bus termination and baud rates.

Use a CAN sniffer (e.g., Arduino with CAN shield) to monitor traffic.

5. Enhancements
Dynamic Data: Make RPM/speed increase/decrease over time.

Fault Simulation: Trigger fake DTCs (e.g., 0x03 for fuel system).

User Input: Add buttons/UI to adjust simulated values.
